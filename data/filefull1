R3U86BSMJW552F Great Tablet. By far better than mini ipad and much much cheaper!!
R1IA8LX8HNBZQI Great device, problem is I have to share with other family members
R3764ZSKWIFCA5 Works fine. Came with everything. Will purchase from seller again.
R3L8R0CWG3O3CF Purchased this through a 3rd party which had it delivered via Amazon. To be honest, I only look to play a few games on it (e.g. Clash of Clans). If you're looking for a "cheaper" device to play games with that spectrum of graphics, pass. I'm sure it's a good device for literally anything else; Movies, books, music, etc. I'm just surprised my Samsung Galaxy S3 phone handles the games better. This device has a lag which is a known issue, but it just can't be fixed at the moment.
R5B3VJINPTS8D I purchased this as a birthday gift for my mother. After helping her turn it on, she was able to install all her apps and even figured out how to sync her third-party email account. This from a lady who can barely send an email. I was worried it would be too small for her to see, but so far it hasn't been an issue. This tablet is blazing fast, much better than my Nexus 7, which is very laggy. This tablet is probably the best you can get for around $150. She absolutely loves it.
R2M3W6I278QFD8 I love all Samsung products but Amazon had this Tab4 on sale and were able to match their competition price allowing me to purchase this unit with great peace of mind. Amazon was great to deal with and delivered the unit within 2 days as promised. Going back to the tablet, I highly recommend getting one, it will make you life easier and wont hurt your budget. Battery life is good, the software is user friendly and the only draw back is the quality of the frame and material used
