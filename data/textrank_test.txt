R3EBSX0P81NH0S	4.0	Very good tablet with a glitch.	1	5	I have a 1 TB hard drive that is not recognized by the GNP. Had the trouble of backing it up and reformat it in FAT32 but it still doesnt work. Reformated it back to NTFS. Otherwise its a great tablet with many functions I didnt have on my Surface RT. Takes a little while to learn how to do things in ANDROID
R2HNP81VG3XQKY	2.0	Nice Concept, Far from Perfect.	2	7	I recently purchase this tablet and decided to return it. The display was nice, very nice. The screen eye sensor didn't work very well and the screen sleep mode kept activating. The reviews and stats claimed this device to have all sorts of processing power but I have to say it was VERY laggy. Even swiping between screens there was noticeable lag. This was with no programs running in the background. Sound from the device was nice. The value just didn't add up for me. For the money, this should have been a more polished offering from Samsung... Battery life was pretty good but nothing a high level tablet shouldn't have...
R14TGSRJ4IHWBI	4.0	Love it.	1	5	I already had a Galaxy Note 10.1 2014. I passed it down to my wife and bought the Note Pro 12.2. The note Pro doesn't work with Smart View or Watch On correctly. Maybe there will be updates later. Overall I love it so far. This is the sweet spot as far as screen size.
R275LW77O0LS6X	4.0	Super screen, heavy, no Flash	1	5	This has a great screen but it is heavy and has no Adobe Flash which means most Internet videos won't play. Also it has "swipe text" that cannot be disabled that often messes up what I'm typing. Apple has better text corrections.
R2E1C2JGO0TDY0	3.0	Can't watch amazon prime	1	5	Excellent but I can't watch amazon prime on it says device not supported other wise is great.... For my photos the resolution is excellent
